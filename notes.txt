#!/usr/bin/env chef-apply
adding the #!/usr/bin/env chef-apply doesn't require you to run as be chef-apply ./apply.rb instead you change it to be executable as chmod +x apply.rb
then run directly using ./apply.rb

lib/chef/resources/file.rb

lib/chef/provider/file.rb

chef-apply doensn't know how to do a cookbook file

# Run in local mode
be chef-client -z -c client.rb

# Run cookbook in local mode
be chef-client -z -c client.rb -r 'recipe[test]'

# Structure is like cookbooks/<recipe-name>/
  inside of that, it can have a metadata.rb file, and a recipes dir, with a default.rb in it.
